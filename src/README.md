# Parsec

**Parsec** is the **P**latform **A**bst**R**action for **SEC**urity, a new open-source initiative to
provide a common API to secure services in a platform-agnostic way.

Find here all the technical documentation of Parsec, alongside user and developer guides.

Go straight to the [overview](overview.md) to learn more about the project! Then, depending on what
you want to know, you can go to the [users](parsec_users.md), [client
developpers](parsec_client/README.md), [service developpers](parsec_service/README.md) or
[security](parsec_security/README.md) sections.

# Disclaimer

Parsec is a new open source project and is under development. This code repository is being made
available so that the developer community can learn and give feedback about the new interfaces and
the concepts of platform-agnostic security. The implementation that is provided is suitable for
exploratory testing and experimentation only. This test implementation does not offer any tangible
security benefits and therefore is not suitable for use in production. Documentation pages may be
incomplete and are subject to change without notice. Interfaces may change in such a way as to break
compatibility with client code. Contributions from the developer community are welcome. Please refer
to the contribution guidelines.
