# Parsec Threat Model

This document presents the generic Parsec Threat Model in a multi-tenant environment.

Parsec could also be deployed in an environment where all clients trust each other and there is no
Identity Provider present, and this would lead to some changes to the Threat Model. *These changes
will be written in italic.*

## Dataflow Diagram

![Dataflow Diagram](diagrams/dataflow_diagram.png)

## Assumptions

Basic requirements based on which the service can operate securely. Mitigations can be implemented
to make the system more resilient, but if some of these assumptions are not met, the security stance
of the service cannot be guaranteed.

1. The hardware modules are physically and functionally secure. Only trusted agents can physically
   access the system.
2. The service is configured and started by a trusted administrator.
3. The OS can be trusted to enforce access-control over critical resources (configuration file, key
   info mappings, communication socket, etc.) and inter-process communication mechanisms.
4. Users with privilege rights are trusted to exercise them in a non-malicious way.
5. The authentication tokens are stored with confidentiality by the clients. *(N/A)*
6. There is a trusted Identity Provider available. *(N/A)*

## Assets

What we want to protect. Each one of these has a combination of security properties:
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. The assets are labelled so that it can be seen in the
threat tables below which ones are impacted by each threat.

### Authentication Token - AS1

The Client Library gets its Authentication Token from the Identity Provider. It is signed by the
IP's private key and sent by the Client Library on each request. Parsec verifies the Authentication
Token using the IP's public key.

**Confidentiality** : if known (the authentication token), an attacker could impersonate a specific
application and execute operations in their name.

*Not applicable for deployments with no Identity Provider. In a deployment without an Identity
Provider tenants will still have an identity in the form of an application name, but all entities in
the system are trusted not to use identities of other tenants and so confidentiality is not
critical.*

### Identity Provider Public Key- AS2

The IP's public certificate is sent to the service periodically. It is used by the service to verify
the authentication tokens.

**Integrity** : if sent by a malicious IP, attackers could then sign their own application
identities and Parsec will verify them successfully. If they know the Authentication Token of
clients, they can impersonate them.

**Availability** : Parsec needs it in order to execute a request.

*Not applicable for deployments with no Identity Provider.*

### Private Keys- AS3

Private keys created by Parsec on behalf of its clients. They should be stored on hardware and never
be extractable.

**Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability** : by nature.

### Client's data- AS4

Data sent by the client as part of a request or data about a client processed by the service. This
could appear in logs.

**Confidentiality** : some of the client's data could be confidential (example: a buffer to
encrypt).

**Integrity** : the data should not be modifiable by attackers. Parsec should be sure that the
source is trusted, and that the client is not being impersonated.

**Availability** : the client should be able to access its stored data in a certain amount of time.

### Configuration data- AS5

Data stored in the configuration file, read at each reloading of Parsec to instantiate components.

**Confidentiality** : the data contains secrets like the user pin of the PKCS 11 device or the owner
hierarchy password of the TPM device.

**Integrity** : the data should only be modified by a trusted Parsec administrator.

**Availability** : the data should be available when loading or re-loading Parsec.

### Availability of the service- AS6

General asset to describe the fact that each client's request should be done in a sane amount of
time. The service should be available at any given point from the moment it is started by the
administrator.

### Key Triple Mappings- AS7

Data containing the mapping between a Key Triple (application name, provider ID, key name) and the
key attributes with a provider-specific identifier of the key. For the Mbed Crypto and PKCS11
providers this is an ID number, for the TPM provider this is the wrapped key.

**Integrity** : Parsec expects this data to be valid.

**Availability** : the data should be available when Parsec needs the specific key.

### Logs- AS8

Data stored in logs emitted by any component of the stack.

**Confidentiality** : the logs can contain confidential information of different parts of the
service.

**Integrity** : the integrity of the logs is essential to prove that some events took place in
Parsec.

**Availability** : the logs should be available for reading and writing when needed.

## Attackers

Each dataflow is analysed from an attacker's perspective using STRIDE method. Nothing is supposed on
the different components.

In the following tables are present the type of each possible threat, its description, its
mitigation status and the assets impacted. A threat can be unmitigated (U), mitigated within the
service (M) or mitigated through operational requirements (O). The assumptions context applies for
all threats but when one of them is particularly relevant, it will be noted with ASUM.

*In deployments without an Identity Provider, the A1, A2 and A10 attackers are not considered in
scope, dependent on the O-10 mitigation being deployed.*

### Attacker "Client Request" - A1

This attacker uses the existing Listener endpoint, created by the service, to communicate with it.

*Not applicable for deployments with no Identity Provider.*

| 0  | An attacker can use all the threads of the service's thread pool, requesting for a time-consuming operation on each one of them, to leave the less amount of free time possible to other clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The requests take more time to execute.                                                                              |
| 2  | The authentication token is stored with confidentiality by the clients. If it is stolen, the service cannot prevent access with it unless the token is revoked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | All the client's keys can be used, and exported if allowed by the key's policy.                                      |

## Operational mitigations

Most of these operational mitigations are implemented when following the [Recommendations on a
Secure Parsec Deployment guide](secure_deployment.md).

|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | A trusted administrator should start the service in such a way that un-privileged processes cannot send signals to the service.                                    | In a Unix OS, using the separate `parsec` user to run the service prevents that.                                                                         |
| 1    | A trusted administrator should check the validity of the providers and hardware modules written in the service's configuration before starting/reloading it.       | This is a manual step that has to be done as part of configuring the service.                                                                            |
| 2    | Clients need to know from a trusted source that a trusted Parsec service is running on their machine so that they can trust the Listener endpoint.                 | The endpoint folder is owned by the `parsec` user, which must have been created by the trusted privileged administrator. This can be checked by clients. |
| 3    | Mappings should be put in a location that only the Parsec service and the trusted administrator can access.                                                        | The mappings are inside the `parsec` user home folder.                                                                                                   |
| 4    | The trusted administrator needs to be notified when any kind of resource is running out.                                                                           | Currently only the logs can be used as a way of knowing that the system is failing because a resource is running out.                                    |
| 5    | Parsec logs coming from the service binary should be redirected to a file that is only writable by the service and readable by the trusted administrator.          | Using systemd, the logs can only be written by the service and read by the `parsec` user. Otherwise, they can be stored in the `parsec` home folder.     |
| 6    | Parsec configuration file should be only writable by the trusted administrator and readable by the service.                                                        | The configuration is in the `parsec` home folder.                                                                                                        |
| 7    | The trusted administrator needs to check that during the boot process the trusted identity provider has successfully given the root trust bundle to the service.   | This is a manual check. It is possible that Parsec would not initialize correctly if the root trust bundle has not been given to it.                     |
| 8    | The hardware descriptors should only be accessible by trusted privileged processes.                                                                                | Manual check but this should be the default on most systems.                                                                                             |
| 9    | The Listener endpoint should be contained in a location that only the Parsec service and the trusted administrator can access (only they can create the endpoint). | The endpoint folder is owned by the `parsec` user and only writable by it.                                                                               |
