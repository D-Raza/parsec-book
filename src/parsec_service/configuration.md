# Parsec Configuration

All Parsec configuration is done at startup and reload with a configuration file. By default, the
`config.toml` file in the current directory is used, but its path can be changed with the `--config`
command-line option.

Please check [here](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/blob/master/config.toml) the
fully-defined template and documentation of a configuration file. You can copy it and tailor it to
your specific deployment.
