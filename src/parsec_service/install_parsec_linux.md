# How to securely install Parsec on Linux

Parsec can be built and installed as a Linux daemon using systemd. The daemon is a systemd user
daemon run by the `parsec` user. Some manual steps are needed to make sure that permissions are set
up correctly so that Parsec is installed respecting the operational mitigations of our [threat
model](../parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/threat_model.md). Currently, Parsec does not support
integration with any Identity Provider. More installation methods will be added in the future when
new identity providers/authenticators are supported.

If your Linux system uses systemd to manage daemons, you can follow these steps. `$DESIRED_FEATURES`
can be a space or comma-separated subset of: `mbed-crypto-provider`, `pkcs11-provider`, and
`tpm-provider`. Choose the providers you want to install depending on what is available on the
platform.

Create the Parsec socket directory.

```
mkdir /tmp/parsec
```

Create the `parsec-clients` group and set the correct permissions on the socket folder. Mutually
trusted Parsec Clients will need to be in that group.

```
sudo groupadd parsec-clients
sudo chown :parsec-clients /tmp/parsec
sudo chmod 750 /tmp/parsec
```

For example, adding the imaginary `parsec-client-1` user to the `parsec-clients` group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G parsec-clients parsec-client-1
```

Users just added to that group might need to log-out and log-in again to make sure the change apply.

Create and log in to a new user named `parsec`.

```
sudo useradd -m parsec
sudo passwd parsec
su --login parsec
```

Depending on which features of Parsec the `parsec` user is going to use, it might need to be given
more privileges in order to access some resources on the system. Refer to the
[Providers](providers.md) page for more information.

In its home directory, pull and install Parsec as a daemon. If a Rust toolchain is not available
widely on the system, it will need to be [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for
that specific user.

```
cargo install parsec-service --features $DESIRED_FEATURES
```

Copy and adapt the [configuration](configuration.md) you want to use. For a secure deployment, make
sure to activate the `log_error_details` option and to use a `trace` log level.

```
cp parsec/config.toml config.toml
```

Install the systemd unit files and activate the Parsec socket.

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp -r parsec/systemd-daemon/parsec.service ~/.config/systemd/user
systemctl --user enable parsec
systemctl --user start parsec
```

`parsec-clients` users can now use Parsec! You can test it (having logged in a `parsec-clients`
user) going inside the `parsec/e2e_tests` directory and:

```
cargo test normal_tests
```

*Note:* if you encounter a "Permission Denied" error while executing the end-to-end tests, make sure
that the group change has taken effect. You can check it by calling `groups` with no arguments. If
you do not see `parsec-clients`, please try logging the user out and in again to apply the change.

Check the Parsec logs with:

```
journalclt --user -u parsec
```

Reload the service:

```
systemctl --user kill -s HUP parsec
```
