# PsaSignHash

Sign an already-calculated hash with a private key. Opcode: 4 (`0x0004`)

## Parameters

| Name       | Type                                                                    | Description                                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key_name` | String                                                                  | Name of the key to use for the operation                                                                              |
| `alg`      | [`AsymmetricSignature`](psa_algorithm.md#asymmetricsignature-algorithm) | An asymmetric signature algorithm that separates the hash and sign operations that is compatible with the type of key |
| `hash`     | Vector of bytes                                                         | The input to sign                                                                                                     |

- `key_name` must be the name of an asymmetric key pair. The key must allow the [usage
   flag](psa_key_attributes.md#usageflags-type) `sign_hash`.
- `hash` is usually the hash of a message. See the detailed description of this function and the
   description of individual signature algorithms for a detailed description of acceptable inputs.

## Results

| Name        | Type            | Description                     |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `signature` | Vector of bytes | Buffer containing the signature |

## Specific response status codes

- `PsaErrorNotPermitted`: The key does not have the `sign_hash` flag, or it does not permit the
   requested algorithm.

## Description

With most signature mechanisms that follow the hash-and-sign paradigm, the hash input to this
function is the hash of the message to sign. The hash algorithm is encoded in the signature
algorithm. Some hash-and-sign mechanisms apply a padding or encoding to the hash. In such cases, the
encoded hash must be passed to this function. The current version of this specification defines one
such signature algorithm: Raw PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

**Note:** To perform a hash-and-sign algorithm, the hash must be calculated before passing it to
this function. This could be done with the operation PsaHashCompute or with a multi-part hash
operation. Those operations are not yet implemented. Alternatively, to hash and sign a message in a
single call, you could use PsaSignMessage.
