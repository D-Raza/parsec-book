# PSA Key Attributes

The attributes are used to fully describe a cryptographic key: its type, size and what is permitted
to do with that key.

Some of the algorithms defined here are deprecated and should not be used without a valid reason. It
is at the discretion of the system administrator whether those algorithms are permitted or not.

**Notice:** not all possible attributes are currently supported by Parsec. Please see the
[Operations Coverage](service_api_coverage.md) for an overview of what Parsec currently supports.
Some of the attributes might not be supported by some providers as it is not in their interface.

## KeyAttributes type

A `KeyAttributes` type contains the following members:

| Name         | Type                           | Description                                       |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `key_type`   | [`KeyType`](#keytype-type)     | Intrinsic category and type of a key              |
| `key_bits`   | Unsigned integer               | Size of a key in bits                             |
| `key_policy` | [`KeyPolicy`](#keypolicy-type) | Policy restricting the permitted usage of the key |

## KeyType type

A `KeyType` type can contain one of the following key types:

- [`RawData`](#rawdata-type)
- [`Hmac`](#hmac-type)
- [`Derive`](#derive-type)
- [`Aes`](#aes-type)
- [`Des`](#des-type)
- [`Camellia`](#camellia-type)
- [`Arc4`](#arc4-type)
- [`Chacha20`](#chacha20-type)
- [`RsaPublicKey`](#rsapublickey-type)
- [`RsaKeyPair`](#rsakeypair-type)
- [`EccKeyPair`](#ecckeypair-type)
- [`EccPublicKey`](#eccpublickey-type)
- [`DhKeyPair`](#dhkeypair-type)
- [`DhPublicKey`](#dhpublickey-type)

### RawData type

Not a valid key type for any cryptographic operation but can be used to store arbitrary data in the
key store.

### Hmac type

HMAC key. The key policy determines which underlying hash algorithm the key can be used for.

### Derive type

A secret key for derivation. The key policy determines which key derivation algorithm the key can be
used for.

### Aes type

Key for a cipher, AEAD or MAC algorithm based on the AES block cipher. The size of the key can be 16
bytes (AES-128), 24 bytes (AES-192) or 32 bytes (AES-256).

### Des type

Key for a cipher or MAC algorithm based on DES or 3DES (Triple-DES). The size of the key can be 8
bytes (single DES), 16 bytes (2-key 3DES) or 24 bytes (3-key 3DES).

**Warning**: Single DES and 2-key 3DES are weak and strongly deprecated and are only recommended for
decrypting legacy data. 3-key 3DES is weak and deprecated and is only recommended for use in legacy
protocols.

### Camellia type

Key for a cipher, AEAD or MAC algorithm based on the Camellia block cipher.

### Arc4 type

Key for the RC4 stream cipher. Use a [`Cipher`](psa_algorithm.md#cipher-algorithm) algorithm with
Stream Cipher variant to use this key with the ARC4 cipher.

**Warning**: The RC4 cipher is weak and deprecated and is only recommended for use in legacy
protocols.

### Chacha20 type

Key for the ChaCha20 stream cipher or the Chacha20-Poly1305 AEAD algorithm. ChaCha20 and the
ChaCha20_Poly1305 construction are defined in [RFC 7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539.html).
Variants of these algorithms are defined by the length of the nonce:

- Implementations must support a 12-byte nonce, as defined in [RFC
   7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539.html).
- Implementations can optionally support an 8-byte nonce, the original variant.
- It is recommended that implementations do not support other sizes of nonce.

Use [`Cipher`](psa_algorithm.md#cipher-algorithm) algorithm with Stream Cipher variant to use this
key with the ChaCha20 cipher for unauthenticated encryption.

### RsaPublicKey type

RSA public key.

### RsaKeyPair type

RSA key pair: both the private and public key.

### EccKeyPair type

supported](#supported-ecc-curve-families).

supported](#supported-ecc-curve-families).

### DhKeyPair type

family supported](#supported-dh-group-families).

supported](#supported-dh-group-families).
